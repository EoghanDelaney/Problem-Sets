This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, 
let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself nameless, 
unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. 
In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that 
understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. I am convinced 
that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days.
